# Steam-Stat-Viewer
Retrieve game specific statistics from Valve's web API and display them to the user via a basic GUI.

# Usage
First, you need to get your API key from here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
Next, you need to edit 'WebAPI.cs' and change the value of apiKey to yours.
Then simply build the project and run it. You can get your steam ID from this website: https://steamid.io/
And you can get the app ID of the game you want from this website: https://steamdb.info/

# Note
This only works for public profiles, if it's private then Steam refuses to give statistics.
